# dicex (Design of Integrated Circuits Examples)

Getting started with SPICE and verilog can be a daunting task. Companies that
make integrated circuits spend millions on Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
tools, and even then, the truth is, they are not great. 

So, expecting open source EDA tools to be a polished, easy to use, easy to learn
tools is too much to ask.

Luckliy, at the beginning of the integrated circuit journey we don't need the
full blown commercial tools. At the beginning, we need to understand the
principles of SPICE, Verilog, how to write the files, how to run the
simulations, and how to view the results.

The difference between open source EDA tools and the commercial tools is that it's
easier to make complex systems with the commercial tools, and believe me, ICs are very complex.

For now though, let's focus on the transistors, resistor,  and the
building blocks for digital circuits, the digital gates.

# Getting started

- Install docker from [docker.com](http://docker.com)
- Install git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloadsm)
- Install TigerVNC from [tigervnc.org](https://tigervnc.org)

For a demo, see [dicex and ciceda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpHw1MB3fus)

Open a terminal (mac, linux) or powershell (windows).

Navigate to where you want your files.

On linux or mac
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/wulffern/dicex
cd dicex
```

On windows

*Multiple people have experienced problems running on windows. I would recommend starting ciceda from windows subsystem for linux instead*

```
git clone https://github.com/wulffern/dicex --config core.autocrlf=input
cd dicex
```

On windows with windows subsystem for linux 2 (WSL2)

Download Ubuntu 20 LTS from app store. Start a Ubuntu shell

```
git clone https://github.com/wulffern/dicex
cd dicex
```

  
On mac

``` sh
./ciceda_mac.sh
```

On windows

``` sh
ciceda_windows.bat
```

On windows with WSL2

``` sh
./ciceda_linux.sh
```


On linux
``` sh
./ciceda_mac.sh
```


Start vncserver if you want GUI

``` sh
./vncstart
```

You will be asked to enter a password the first time. The password is for the
VNC server, and you can use whatever.

vncstart is a short shell script that starts a vncserver, it looks like this

``` sh
$ cat vncstart
vncserver :0 -geometry 1920x1200
```

If the text in the VNC connection is too small, then change the geometry to fit your screen resolution
(or the aspect ratio). You need to kill the vncserver if you want to start a new
one with a different geometry.

``` sh
vncserver -kill :0
```

Open TigerVNC, or on mac Finder -> Go -> Connect to server , connect to *localhost:5900*

# SPICE

The folders called ex1 etc are related to the course TFE4152 Design of
integrated circuits 

There are a few examples in spice/, for example 
``` sh
cd sim/spice/NCHIO
make
```
# Verilog
Examples for verilog are in ~/sim/verilog, for example
``` sh
cd sim/verilog/
```
 
Start waveform viewer
``` sh
gtkwave &
```

Run simulation
``` sh
make
```

In GTKWave, File -> Open New Tab. Find counter/test.vcd


# Support
I would try carstenw@ntnu.no, however, I get about 100 emails per day, so my
response rate is not great.
